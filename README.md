# Academic Sustainability Dashboard

The Academic Sustainability Dashboard is a web-based front-end application designed for the School of Mathematical, Physical, and Computational Sciences. This project aims to provide a platform for PhD students and staff to monitor and assess carbon emissions from travel-related activities. A key feature is the integration of a PowerBI dashboard, uniquely crafted to calculate and manage users' carbon budgets.

## Features

### 1. Real-time Carbon Emission Tracking
- The dashboard allows users to track travel-associated carbon emissions in real-time, offering a comprehensive overview of individual and collective environmental impact.

### 2. Educational Insights
- The dashboard includes educational elements, providing users with insights into the environmental implications of different travel choices. This promotes a deeper understanding of the broader sustainability landscape.
